# Handle

Handle is a child theme of [Axe](https://github.com/adampatterson/Axe)

Opening `theme-helpers.php` and uncommenting the function on [line 6](https://github.com/adampatterson/Handle/blob/master/lib/theme-helpers.php#L6) and allows the child theme to serve all of your themes assets.

You would also be building your assets in the child theme and should move your assets to reflect that change.
